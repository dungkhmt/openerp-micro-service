          In the field of logistics and supply chain management, transporting goods between ports and warehouses is
          essential, and this is done using containers. Customers place requests for moving goods either from warehouses
          to ports or between different warehouses. In this process, trucks, trailers, and containers are distinct
          entities. Here's how the process typically includes:
        </Typography>
        <ol>
          <li><Typography>
            A truck goes to a depot to pick up a trailer.
          </Typography></li>
          <li><Typography>
            The truck with trailer attached (truck-trailer) heads to another depot to collect an empty container.
          </Typography></li>
          <li><Typography>
            The truck-trailer proceeds to a warehouse to load goods into the container.
          </Typography></li>
          <li><Typography>
            Once loaded, the truck-trailer transports the container (one or two) with goods loaded, to another warehouse or a port.
            Upon arrival, the container is unloaded using specialized equipment.
          </Typography></li>
          <li><Typography>
            If this equipment is unavailable, the trailer (with the container still on it) is detached from the truck.
            The truck (or truck-trailer) will continue to travel for serving other requests.
          </Typography></li>
        </ol>
      </Box>
    </CardContent>
