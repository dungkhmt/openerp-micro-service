    "description": "A tourist has discovered a time machine and decides to visit historical events. Given a list of events with their respective dates and locations, create an itinerary that minimizes the temporal and geographical distance traveled. Assume the time machine requires 24 hours to recharge between jumps and that the tourist prefers to witness events in chronological order.",

    "description": "A village has a network of water pipes connecting n houses to m water sources. Each house i requires r_i liters of water, and each source j can supply up to s_j liters. The network is represented by a connection matrix C where C[i][j] = 1 if house i is connected to source j, and 0 otherwise. Given the requirements [r_1, r_2, ..., r_n], the supply capacities [s_1, s_2, ..., s_m], and the matrix C, compute the distribution strategy.",

    "description": "A homeowner wants to install solar panels on their property. Given the dimensions of the available roof space (length and width), and the dimensions of each solar panel, determine how many panels can be installed on the roof. Assume that panels cannot be overlapped or cut to fit and must be laid out in a grid aligning with the edges of the roof.",

    "title": "The Lost Socks Mystery",
    "description": "Every time you do laundry, there's a mysterious phenomenon where socks disappear. Starting with S pairs of socks, after doing laundry n times, with a disappearance rate of r% (a percentage of single socks, not pairs, that disappear in each laundry session), calculate the number of complete pairs of socks left. The challenge is to create a formula that minimizes sock loss over time.",
